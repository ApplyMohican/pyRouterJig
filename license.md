==========

* This software and its output is not an INCRA product.  The authors have no
connection with INCRA (or Taylor Design Group, Inc.), aside from being users
themselves of their products.
* Woodworking can be dangerous, and in particular, using a router or other tools
to cut joints is dangerous.  You can loose your eyesight, fingers, and suffer
other serious, even fatal, injuries.
* The authors of {{ site.codename }} are not responsible for any injury,
death, or financial loss that could conceivably be caused by using
{{ site.codename }}.
* As a user of {{ site.codename }}, only you are responsible for using the
output of {{ site.codename }} safely and responsibly.
* The templates and patterns for joints that {{ site.codename }}  generate are
simply suggestions for joints.  There is no implication that the joints can be
safely cut with your tools (even if you have a Festool router).
* You are solely responsible for operating your tools in a safe manner.  If
you feel {{ site.codename }} could conceivably encourage you to operate your tools in
an unsafe manner, don\'t use {{ site.codename }}.
* {{ site.codename }} does no stress or strength
analysis of the joints it generates (although we would happily accept code
changes that would do such analysis).
* There is no implication of any
particular joint\'s strength.  The joint may fail, even if you glue it up
properly. {{ site.codename }} is not responsible for joint failures.
* There is no guarantee that {{ site.codename }} is accurate, or even generates a
feasible joint.  Errors in {{ site.codename }} might result a joint pattern that does
not fit and destroy your otherwise perfect woodworking project.
* In summary, if you believe, or you believe that your survivors might believe,
that it is even remotely possible that {{ site.codename }} could cause you and your
family serious bodily injury or death, break your tools, or ruin your
woodworking project, do not use {{ site.codename }}.
