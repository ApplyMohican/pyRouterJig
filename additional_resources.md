Tutorials
---------

I highly recommend the following tutorials put together by Phil
Barrett:

* [Custom Box Joints using the Incra LS System](http://philliplynebarrett.wix.com/philsbunker#!custom-box-joints/f9xbm).
  This is an excellent introduction to {{ site.codename }}.
* [Box Joint Clamping Cauls using pyRouterJig](http://philliplynebarrett.wix.com/philsbunker#!creating-box-joint-cauls/q2r7v).

Phil makes beautiful boxes and other wood projects.  He has worthwhile tips
not only for {{ site.codename }}, but also for woodworking and router use in
general.  Take a look at [his
portfolio](http://philliplynebarrett.wix.com/philsbunker#!portfolio/lleih).

Websites
--------

* [http://www.routerforums.com/](http://www.routerforums.com/) is an excellent
  forum on routers, with very nice and patient members.  No question is too
  stupid for them, as I have demonstrated many times.
* [http://www.wood-database.com/](http://www.wood-database.com/) is an
  excellent place to get wood grain images.  See the documentation
  [Wood Pattern Selection]({{ site.baseurl }}/wood_patterns) on how to use these images.
