Special thanks to the following individuals:

* Phil Barrett for his numerous suggestions for improvement and testing help.
I'm always amazed at the bugs he finds.  Among many great ideas, in particular
he should be credited with the ideas of storing the joint metadata in the
`PNG` file, the clamping caul template, and the easy template alignment method.  He
also tests on Windows 10.  Finally, he put together [this great tutorial](http://philliplynebarrett.wix.com/philsbunker#!custom-box-joints/f9xbm)
of {{ site.codename }}.
* George Salek for testing (particularly on Windows XP), finding bugs and
issues with metric units.

{{ site.codename }} depends upon and is extremely grateful for the following
open-source software efforts:

* [Python](http://www.python.org)
* [PyQt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/)
* [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/)
* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/)
